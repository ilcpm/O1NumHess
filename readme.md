# O1NumHess

usage:

```bash
python3 setup.py install
```

Note that the above command installs the package for all users, and requires root privileges. If the user does not have access to root privileges, or if it is not desired to install the package for all users, then one should use the following command instead:

```bash
python3 setup.py install --prefix ~/.local
```
